<br/>
<br/>
  Note:<br>SQL uses Boolean value for 'True' and 'False' - Where 0 = 'False' and 1 = 'True'<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
<b>2. </b>Let's check the suspicious event logs that occurred on '2022-05-09'. Let's retrieve all login attempts that happened this day and the day before ('2022-05-08').<br/>
